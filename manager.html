		On 4 July 2019, Lampard was appointed as the new head coach at former club Chelsea on a three-year contract, making him the first English manager to manage the side in over two decades.[209] In Lampard's first competitive game with Chelsea, the club lost 4–0 to Manchester United on the opening day of the 2019-20 Premier League season. It was the biggest defeat for a Chelsea manager in their first game since Danny Blanchflower's team was beaten 7–2 by Middlesbrough in December 1978.[210] In Lampard's second competitive game with Chelsea, they lost again, this time against Liverpool in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup 2–2 after extra time, losing 5–4 on penalties. On 24 August 2019, Lampard obtained his first win as a Chelsea manager in the Premier League against Norwich City, in a 2–3 away win.[211] On 25 September 2019, Chelsea picked up their first home win under Lampard's tenure beating League Two side Grimsby Town 7–1 in the EFL Cup. Lampard's matchday squad against Grimsby featured ten academy graduates, with Marc Guehi, Reece James, Tino Anjorin and Ian Maatsen all being handed their debuts for the club, as well as a first start for Billy Gilmour.[212] Lampard won the Premier League Manager of the Month award for October 2019 after Chelsea's 100 percent win record in the league for that month.[213]
